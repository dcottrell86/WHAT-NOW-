# WHAT-NOW-

I keep on asking myself every morning as im setting up my dinner table for my son learning station. Asking "WHAT? In the world are we going to deal with next year with our kids as they progress to the next grade?"
"NOW" We have to rush teaching our students in order for them to be able to be right where they should be.
Will there work be looked over and excused or will the get left behind. Going to school is a must and we spent to much time out of school. I say summer school is a must for everyone lets pick up where we left off. 
Parents, teachers, leaders of school board how do u feel? What will be done with our leaders of tomorrow that may have an issue of sort?
